The conflict featured hundreds---perhaps thousands---of armed groups forming various kinds of alliances, only to break apart and later reconcile.\n\nA lot is made of the role of ideology when armchair commanders (like myself) comment on these unfolding disasters. But alliances can also be pragmatic choices. By aggregating combat power, armed groups might increase their chances of survival---even if only to turn on each other at a later stage.\n\nRecently, I came across a compelling argument in *Alliance Formation in Civil Wars by Fotini Christia.*[^1] In this book, Christia states: *\"It would be natural to suppose that warring groups form alliances based on shared identity considerations---such as Christian groups allying with Christian groups or Muslim groups with their fellow co-religionists---but this is not what we see.\"*\n\n[^1]: Fotini Christia, \"[Alliance Formation in Civil Wars](https://www.amazon.com/Alliance-Formation-Professor-Fotini-Christia/dp/1107683483/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=alliance+formation+in+civil+wars&qid=1692661337&s=books&sprefix=alliance+formation%2Cstripbooks%2C100&sr=1-1)\".\n\nWith that motivation in mind, I decided to explore what we could learn from Syrian armed group coalitions. When these groups engaged in battle, they frequently partnered with multiple other factions. This raised a key question for me: **Would groups tolerate fighting alongside ideological enemies?**\n\nSo, I focused on **pairwise relationships**, even within multi-group alliances.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggraph)\nlibrary(tidygraph)\nlibrary(rsvg)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(igraph)\nlibrary(devtools)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Data\n\n::: callout-important\n## A love affair with ACLED data!\n\nI came across the [Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)](https://www.acleddata.com) a few years ago---and what an amazing resource.\n\nACLED is a disaggregated data collection, analysis, and crisis mapping project. The ACLED team collects both real-time and historical data on political violence and protest events across nearly 100 countries.\n\nIn short, it's an outstanding tool for understanding the dynamics of conflict. .[^2]\n:::\n\n[^2]: I accessed the [data from The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)](https://www.acleddata.com) in the spring of 2021.\n\nACLED data is robust, with many columns and coverage spanning multiple years. In this dataset, the `actor1` column (along with `assoc_actor_1`) represents entities that are acting together---typically in some form of violence---against `actor2`.\n\nFor this analysis, I'm only concerned with `actor1` and `assoc_actor_1`, since I'm interested in **collaborations**, not opponents. These columns capture groups that are working together during a reported event.\n\nLet's take a quick peek at the data:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nread_csv(\"df_acled_syr_2017_2021.csv\") |> \n  select(year, event_date, event_type, actor1, assoc_actor_1) |> \n  filter(!is.na(assoc_actor_1)) |>\n  slice_head(n = 5) |> \n  knitr::kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| year|event_date |event_type                 |actor1                           |assoc_actor_1                                                |\n|----:|:----------|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2021|2021-02-05 |Battles                    |Operation Peace Spring           |JWS: Syrian National Army; Military Forces of Turkey (2016-) |\n| 2021|2021-02-05 |Battles                    |Opposition Rebels (Syria)        |Military Forces of Turkey (2016-)                            |\n| 2021|2021-02-05 |Explosions/Remote violence |Al Fath Al Mubeen Operation Room |Opposition Rebels (Syria)                                    |\n| 2021|2021-02-05 |Battles                    |Military Forces of Syria (2000-) |Militia (Pro-Government)                                     |\n| 2021|2021-02-04 |Explosions/Remote violence |Opposition Rebels (Syria)        |Military Forces of Turkey (2016-)                            |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nI need select the columns of interest and then filter down to battle related events (filtering out `Protests`, `Riots`, and `Violence against civilians`)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_acled_syr <- \n  read_csv(\"df_acled_syr_2017_2021.csv\") |> \n  filter(year %in% 2017:2019,\n         event_type %in% c(\"Explosions/Remote violence\",\n                           \"Battles\",\n                           \"Strategic developments\")) |> \n  select(actor1, assoc_actor_1) |> \n  mutate(actor1 = str_squish(actor1),\n         assoc_actor_1 = str_squish(assoc_actor_1)) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHere's the difficult part.

This next part stumped me and took forever. First, a huge shout out to Wikipedia contributors. There are soooo many actors in the dataset. I spend much more time than intended trying to consolidate them, constantly referencing Wikipedia to figure out what's going on.\n\nSecond, I needed to clean and consolidate the actors, and then remove the non-opposition groups as well as the non-armed-opposition groups. I tried several ways to make happen much more parsimoniously with `sapply` and `purrr::map` and a two-column lookup table, but it beat me.
