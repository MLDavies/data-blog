## Proxy wars

Violence, conflict, and proxy warfare -- all on a blissful, dreamy Sunday afternoon. Actually, I was listening to an NPR discussion on an afternoon drive that referenced the work of the [Proxy War Project out of Virginia Tech](https://publishing.vt.edu/site/books/series/pwp-conflict-studies/). As a data geek, the next obvious question is: Gee, where can I find data on that?

I'm not sure how much the general public thinks about the threat of proxy warfare. Is it a rag tag group of thugs funded by a dark agency and left to run around the forest? Or maybe proxy wars are a relic of the cold war? Well, [according to War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2021/09/the-return-of-great-power-proxy-wars/) (a super cool site on all things war and conflict), "\[e\]vents of the last decade suggest the increasing salience of such conflicts." The blog goes on to say that "\[p\]roxy wars are poised to be a...significant factor in the evolving strategic environment."

So, as soon as I got home, I jumped online for a quick search for some data. The first thing I found [was the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proxy_wars). It most certainly is not the most comprehensive data, but it has a nice feature: A helpful Wiki contributor created a typology of proxy wars. I decided to scrape it to started some initial exploration.

I'm not intending for this to be a deep dive into coding or proxy war dynamics. This is just a quick and dirty scrape of Wikipedia data to get a sense of what's going.

## Scraping and Cleaning Wikipedia Data

```{r}
#| label: scrape-data

# libraries
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
source("my_gg_theme.R")

# Scrape the tables from the page
proxy_tables <- 
  read_html('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proxy_wars') %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE) %>% 
  # set names based on Wikipedia names
  set_names(
    c(
      'Caveat',
      'Series', 
      'Pre-World War I proxy wars', 
      'Inter-war period proxy wars',
      'Cold War proxy wars',
      'Modern proxy wars',
      'Ongoing proxy wars'
    )) 
```

The Wikipedia page displays the following caveat:

> This article or section appears to be slanted towards recent events. Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. (October 2022)

Wikipedia spread the data across a number of tables. To prep the data for plotting, I put them into one big data frame and did some minor cleaning. In particular, the dates were a little jenky. The resulting data looks like:

```{r}
# data cleaning
proxy_data_df <- 
  # drop unneeded data
  proxy_tables[-c(1,2)] %>% 
  map2_df(
    names(proxy_tables[-c(1,2)]),
    ~mutate(.x, war_type = .y)) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(
    dates, 
    into = c('start_year', 'end_year'), 
    sep = "â€“") %>%
  mutate(across(
    start_year:end_year,
    ~ str_extract(.x, '[0-9]{4}') %>% 
    as.numeric(.x))) %>% 
  mutate(across(
    c(war, combatant_1, combatant_1, result),
    ~ str_remove(., "\\[.*\\]$")))

proxy_data_df %>% 
  slice_head(n = 5) %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 7)
```

## Plotting war duration

To avoid rewriting a bunch of code, let's create a little function to select the war-type of choice and plot the data. (Note, the plotting code was a little long and distracting, so I pushed some of it to a source script.)

```{r}

# a function to select war type and plot
war_plot <- function(df, type) {
  
  df %>% 
    filter(
      war_type == type
    ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(
      x = fct_reorder(war, -start_year),
      y = start_year)) +
    geom_segment(aes(
      xend = war, 
      yend = end_year), 
      color = "cadetblue",
      alpha = 0.75) +
    # year start
    geom_point(color = "orange", # #E69F00
               size = 3,
               alpha = 0.8) +
    # year end
    geom_point(aes(
      y = end_year), 
      color = "cadetblue", 
      size = 3,
      alpha = 0.8) +  
    
    coord_flip() +
    labs(
      x = "", 
      y = "",
      title = type
      ) +
    # a sourced function for some trivial formatting 
    quick_gg_theme()
}
```

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-height: 4
war_plot(proxy_data_df, "Pre-World War I proxy wars")

war_plot(proxy_data_df, 'Inter-war period proxy wars')
```

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-height: 4
war_plot(proxy_data_df, 'Modern proxy wars')

war_plot(proxy_data_df, 'Ongoing proxy wars')
```

```{r}
#| fig-height: 8
war_plot(proxy_data_df, 'Cold War proxy wars')
```

## Wrap up

First, that's a lot o' proxy wars. Of course, there's clearly a few problems with the data. Some dates are missing. And I'm suspicious about the ongoing proxy wars. Are they all really still ongoing?

The Cold War was fertile ground for proxy wars. I guess it makes sense, right? Cold wars are characterized by indirect conflict, working through proxies, pawns, and agents of mayhem.

Given that proxy wars are frequently a means for "agents" to have deniability regarding the havoc they are wrecking, there is likely a large number of unreported/undiscovered agent-proxy relationships.

It might be interesting to parse the text-based columns and see which actors are most frequently leveraging proxies, and in what parts of the world...another day...
