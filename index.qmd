Welcome to my data science-sandbox. I come here to play and explore data, quantitative methods, and the intersections among society, the arts, and conflict. I've always been intrigued by the complex dynamics and passions of society, and this blog is a platform for exploring all that through the lens of data science.

I'm a former professional dancer turned U.S. Army Reservist turned data scientist. My life has been a nutty blend of "So You Think You Can Dance", "Band of Brothers" and "Money Ball."

Let me be clear: I make no claims that what I'm doing here would pass academic muster. This is more like stumbling into a private studio or workshop. I do my best to be thoughtful and thorough, but you won't find any peer-reviewed publications here (though let's be honest, that process has taking some heat in recent years anyway).

So poke around. I hope you find something interesting. If you find it useful, steal it. If you have comments or suggestions, I would love to hear them. 

Thanks for being here!
